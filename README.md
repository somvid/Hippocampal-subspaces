Dasom Kwon, Jungwoo Kim, Seng Bum Michael Yoo, & Won Mok Shim. (2024). Coordinated Computations for Naturalistic Memory Encoding and Retrieval within Hippocampal Subspaces.

Raw fMRI data and a structured fMRI data matrix are available at https://openneuro.org/datasets/ds005468.

You can use the structured fMRI data matrix (e.g., Hippocampal_patterns_during_movie_watching.npy) to run the code.

Alternatively, you can process the raw fMRI data by running the fMRIprep and preprocessing scripts available on this GitHub repository
